2025-06-07 Entry
  So I've thought about what I mean by "Multiterrain Vehicle," and decided to go for the land and water route. So I'll create a boat with retracting/folding     wheels that become out of sight when in boat-mode.
  
  But the CHALLENGES:
    Water is the BIGGEST difficulty, but I know I can waterproof everything but the drive and steering motors. I believe I can research and implement some solutions.
    
  My first step will be a mock-up CAD drawing of the basic functions I'll have in the final product.
