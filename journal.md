  The initial plan for this project was for it to be a multiterrain vehicle, but I have put that idea on hold as a submarine sounds very fun and uniquely challenging to make. Today, I changed all of that information and have begun my sketching.

  Current challenges on my mind:
    Waterproofing
    Stability
    Resurfacing
    Connection at depths
    Emergency Recovery
